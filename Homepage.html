    <h1 class="center-text">A bit about me</h1>
    <p>My name is Sicheng Yu, and I graduated from Arizona State University with a degree in Supply Chain Management. It was a serendipitous encounter when I met a friend at the gym who mentioned that he was building a data center. This piqued my interest, and I realized that in addition to my economic knowledge, it's crucial to acquire real-world application skills. Consequently, I decided to pursue a program at BU MET CS.

        While coding can be exhausting, I find it enjoyable most of the time, especially when I understand what I'm doing. To relieve stress, I make it a point to work out almost every day, and I've managed to achieve a bench press of 265 pounds.
        
        My favorite game, Dota 2, has taken a back seat in my life as I haven't played it for a year and a half due to time constraints. However, I still enjoy watching it occasionally. Lastly, I hope you like my website.</p>
