<h1 class="center-text">Welcome to my Dota2 world!!</h1>

<p>
    As you might have guessed, I used a Dota 2 theme to design my website. Dota 2, short for "Defense of the Ancients 2," is a highly popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. Released in 2013 as a sequel to the original Dota, it has since become one of the most prominent titles in the esports world.
</p>

<p>
    In Dota 2, two teams, each consisting of five players, compete to destroy the opponent's Ancient, a heavily fortified structure at their base. Players select from a vast roster of heroes, each with unique abilities and roles, to form a balanced team. The game combines strategic thinking, teamwork, and precise execution, with matches often lasting 30-45 minutes.
</p>

<p>
    Dota 2's competitive scene boasts enormous prize pools and a passionate global fanbase, making it a cornerstone of the esports industry. The game's deep complexity and ever-evolving meta ensure a dynamic and engaging experience for both casual and professional players.

<h2 class="center-text">Why I played this game?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Reflexes and Reaction Time: Dota 2 is a fast-paced game that often requires split-second decisions and reactions. Playing the game can help improve your hand-eye coordination and reaction time as you learn to respond quickly to various in-game events, such as enemy attacks, skill shots, and ganks.</li>
    
    <li>Strategic Thinking: Dota 2 is a highly strategic game that involves complex decision-making. You must analyze the current game state, including hero compositions, map control, and item builds, to make effective choices. This can enhance your ability to think critically and strategically in high-pressure situations, skills that are valuable in many aspects of life.</li>
    
    <li>Teamwork and Communication: Dota 2 is a team-based game that requires effective communication and collaboration with teammates. Learning to coordinate strategies, make tactical decisions, and adapt to your team's strengths and weaknesses can improve your teamwork and interpersonal skills.</li>
    
    <li>Adaptability: The ever-evolving meta in Dota 2 forces players to adapt to new strategies, heroes, and playstyles. Adapting to changes in the game can enhance your ability to think on your feet and adjust to unexpected situations.</li>
    
    <li>Problem Solving: Dota 2 presents a wide range of in-game challenges and problems that need to be solved. Whether it's figuring out how to counter an opponent's strategy or making decisions in the heat of battle, the game promotes problem-solving skills.</li>
